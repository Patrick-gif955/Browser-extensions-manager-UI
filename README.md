Browser Extensions Manager UI

A responsive front-end interface that simulates a browser extensions management dashboard. It enables users to filter extensions by status — all, active, or inactive — through interactive buttons that dynamically update the view.

The project uses a .json file as a data source, allowing extension information to be fetched, filtered, and rendered dynamically with JavaScript. This structure improves scalability and maintains a clean separation between data and presentation.

Building this project strengthened my understanding of DOM manipulation, asynchronous data handling, and responsive layout design using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
